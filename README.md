# Game Play #
<p>Buldozer must move all the box to destination point

Buldozer can not hit wall<br/>
Buldozer can only push one box, and cannot pull the box<br/>
Bulldozers can not push the box that is attached to the wall<br/>

Win if all box is above all point<br />
You can lose if the box is too close to the wall, because buldozer cannot pull the box</p>
